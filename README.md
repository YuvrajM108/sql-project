# SQL Project

In this project I complete the questions from tutorials 0-9 on [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial).

## Getting Started
- To make a copy of the project on your local machine, you can either download the project files in a zip folder or type git clone into your git commandline followed by the URL of this repository.
- The correct answer to each question in the tutorials can be found in the commands.sql file.
